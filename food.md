# What to eat

I am still sketching this part.

## Cafe Luna

THE brunch place in Cambridge, toward Central Sq on the MIT side.  You can try for reservations [here](http://www.cafeluna-centralsq.com/brunch/).  Space is very limited, and the wait time for Sunday brunch can easily push 2 hours.

### Things to get

Honey butter biscuits.  Eggs benedict.  Latte.  Basically anything.

## B Goode

Vaguely healthy eatery in Harvard.

### Things to get

Kale apple bacon bowl.

## Berry Line

The indy Harvard froyo place.

### Things to get

House-made mochi as a topping.

## Tasty Burger

Burgers, fries, and beers with bar and pool tables downstairs.  The food is very rich/OK, but it is an institution.

### Things to get

The burger with pineapple.

## Life Alive

Vegetarian new-agey rice bowl/wrap place by Central square.

### Things to get

The emperor bowl.  Om nom.

## Flat Patties

A solid burger place, regularly recommended in Boston eatery threads.

### Things to get

Basically anything.

## L A Burdicks

The Cambridge chocolatier.  Expensive, but the cannot-fail gift.

### Things to get

Their hot chocolate is very rich and particularly special.
