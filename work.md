# Places to Work

## Library

The Cambridge public library is awesome.

### Upsides

Location is very near Harvard, has a bikeshare stand right out front.

Wifi, plugs, bathrooms, fountains, very comfortable tables.

No table rent.

Upstairs is a quiet area, and that rule is generally respected.

Great views, particularly in weather.  If you arrive early enough to take one of the corner tables with clear windows to the outside on a day with weather, it is very peaceful.  Especially nice for snow.

### Downsides

Not a ton.  Sometimes screamy children can be heard downstairs.  No on-site food, and fluids other than water are banned upstairs.  The toilet paper is cheap.

## BKBS

The climbing gym in Somerville.  They also have a coworking area.  Basically the place to be for a certain demographic.

### Upsides

[All the climbing](http://brooklynboulders.com/somerville/about/photos/#!).

Two bouldering walls, an auto-belay island, and one long auto belay near the tongue.  Stand-up desks for use on the treadmills.  A quiet conference room (that is sometimes reserved, but no one has ever complained about me camping there otherwise).  A quiet room with a fireplace and N64.  A sauna.

A coworking area next to the weight racks with plugs.  Wifi is ubiquitous.  Slack lines, free yoga class with membership (though I never managed to go.  They are super packed early.)

Right next to Aeronaut (brewery) and Artisan's Asylum (maker space).  Bikeshare stand somewhat nearby.

Being able to walk away from a problem, climb a thing, and come back is really nice.

### Downsides

The bathrooms are small for the number of people the gym serves, and they were under construction when I left.

The seating in the quiet room is a bit uncomfortable/bad for work posture.


## 1369

The local pair of coffeeshops.  Basically on top of bike share stops.

### Upsides

Good lattes and reasonable breakfast items.  Tables are usually comfortable.  Good views for people/weather watching.

### Downsides

Spending every day here can get expensive as you pay table rent to justify camping out.

Almost unusable for work on weekends, as they get super packed.

## Harvard Starbucks

Exactly what you think it is.

### Upsides

Most of the Starboxen are bad, but the Harvard location is quite nice.  Go to the back left corner to find the stairs to the upstairs area, which has lots of seating and some great people watching of Harvard Square.

### Downsides

Its Starbucks.  Support local business and drink real coffee!  Also, the demand for this space from students is very strong. Getting a seat can sometimes be dodgy.
