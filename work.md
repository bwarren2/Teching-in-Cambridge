# Places to Work

## Library

The Cambridge public library is awesome.

### Upsides

Location is very near Harvard, has a bikeshare stand right out front.

Wifi, plugs, bathrooms, fountains, very comfortable tables.

No table rent.

Upstairs is a quiet area, and that rule is generally respected.

Great views, particularly in weather.  If you arrive early enough to take one of the corner tables with clear windows to the outside on a day with weather, it is very peaceful.  Especially nice for snow.

### Downsides

Not a ton.  Sometimes screamy children can be heard downstairs.  No on-site food, and fluids other than water are banned upstairs.  The toilet paper is cheap.

## BKBS

The climbing gym in Somerville.
