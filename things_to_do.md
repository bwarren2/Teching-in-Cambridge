## November Project

The local fitness cult.  It's free, fun, and usually hard.

### Upsides

Mondays are Event Deck; a location in the greater Boston area is announced over the weekend, if it is less than 5 miles from your house you are supposed to run there, and the leaders run a workout.  Usually there is a deck of cards involved for choosing activity and reps.

Wednesdays are Stadium Steps.  Everyone runs to Harvard Stadium too early in the morning and does many, many stairs.  (This is most of what I did.)

Friday is hill running at a particular hill I never went to.

A great group of fun people, there are occasionally events (like a run followed by beer and party.)  **I suspect this is very much your kind of group.**

### Downsides

Everything is early so people are done with time before work.

## Python meetup

Run by Ned Batchelder, who is famous in the Python community and runs a great meetup.

### Upsides

The talks are usually good.  Lots of smart people there, including several who give PyCon talks regularly.  Free pizza paid by recruiting companies, usually free beer afterward.

### Downsides

Not many.  The location is a little out of the way in the Microsoft building, in the MIT area near the bridge.
