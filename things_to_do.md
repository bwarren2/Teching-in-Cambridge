## November Project

The local fitness cult.  It's free, fun, and usually hard.

### Upsides

Mondays are Event Deck; a location in the greater Boston area is announced over the weekend, if it is less than 5 miles from your house you are supposed to run there, and the leaders run a workout.  Usually there is a deck of cards involved for choosing activity and reps.

Wednesdays are Stadium Steps.  Everyone runs to Harvard Stadium too early in the morning and does many, many stairs.  (This is most of what I did.)

Friday is hill running at a particular hill I never went to.

A great group of fun people, there are occasionally events (like a run followed by beer and party.)  **I suspect this is very much your kind of group.**

### Downsides

Everything is early so people are done with time before work.

## Python meetup

Run by Ned Batchelder, who is famous in the Python community and runs a great meetup.

### Upsides

The talks are usually good.  Lots of smart people there, including several who give PyCon talks regularly.  Free pizza paid by recruiting companies, usually free beer afterward.

### Downsides

Not many.  The location is a little out of the way in the Microsoft building, in the MIT area near the bridge.

## Inman Oasis

Community hot tubs as a service.

### Upsides

If you bring your own towel and use the frequent soaker program (aka buy a ten-pack), it comes out to $10 for 30 minutes.  During the especially cold winter days when you just need to be _warm_, or when all your muscles are sore, this is really nice.

A good circuit: work at 1369 next door for a while, then wind down with a soak, then hit the Whole Foods a block away if you are in walking distance to wherever home is.

Bike share right across the street.

## Downsides

The massages are only OK for the price.   Sometimes the tubs are full and you need to wait/come back later.  (Not that bad with 1369 basically next door.)

## Kayaking

### Upsides

While the weather is good, this is a great way to see the town from a new vantage point.  Starting from the MIT waterfront and going North will take you past some cool bridges, going south and west will take you past all of Cambridge (and there is a separate dropoff station that way, for a fee.)

Frequent user programs are available, according to my old roommate.

### Downsides

IIRC it can get a little expensive, but check that.

## Qi foot spa

A [massage place](https://www.yelp.com/biz/qi-foot-spa-cambridge) near Harvard.  Affordable and strong value per dollar.  Shares an entrance with a salon.

### Upsides

A pretty good chair massage for the price.  Also good foot massage.  There are deals if you are flexible enough to go during their off hours, aka during the day.

### Downsides

You might have a communications problem with whoever answers the phone.  This is a pretty casual operation.
